#How-do-I-reach-these-kids-

A text adventure game for a school project

##Name of the game:

‘How do I reach these kids?’

##Rules:

-A simple text adventure putting the user through a variety of (comic) situations where they have to make the correct multiple-choice selection to best teach their class of rowdy, would-be developers the proper way to code.
-If the player’s score is high enough, the class graduates and becomes rich and famous. If not, the class fails and is forced to turn to lives of crime.

##MVP for this project:

A simple, cut-and-dry text adventure game with 5 multiple-choice scenarios, a visible running score for the user that also indicates how close they are to getting the class to “pass” with simple static backgrounds or no images at all, just styled text.

##Reach Goals:

-Write out a high number of questions (at least 20) as part of several branching narratives
-Instead of multiple-choice questions, make it a true text adventure game where the user enters commands
-Create an effect where every time the user has to answer questions, the screen transitions to a “battle screen” a la Pokemon or most any RPG games
-A high-scorer page

##Technology:

-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-jQuery

##How does it work?:

-Series of questions presenting the user with tongue-in-cheek challenges
-User has 4 options to choose from - points awarded based on (completely arbitrary) criteria in 10, 5, 2.5 or 0 point increments
-Obnoxious, individualized feedback - every answer has a unique response
-Final question diverges based on player’s score after 4 questions

##Pain points:

-Unexpected loss of time due to eye injury
-Extreme simplicity
-24 unique responses for 24 unique situations required lots of organization, pre-writing and careful, careful typing

##Missing desired features:

-More questions, and more divergent paths based on user score, selections
-Text input field instead of multiple-choice format

##Approach:

-Set up layout of page
-Use dummy math problems for starters
-Design logic for just one problem
-Test and debug
-With template set, scale up with 4 questions
-Design logic check for final, 5th problem based on user’s score
-Replace dummy math problems with actual narrative-based questions
